# Project Diary

## Date: 1th October 2024

### Summary
- Today, I concentrated on determining the specific sub-problem I will focus on for comparing ML algorithms. After some consideration, I decided to pursue **churn prediction**. 
- I also began evaluating wich datasets i would be using in this project. In contention between Telecom's data set and Bank dataset.

### Next Steps
- Contiune researching and start writing up a project plan
- Research some basic machine learning models, such as nearest neighbours, to establish a foundational understanding.
- Continue exploring potential datasets for benchmarking and implementation in the churn prediction model.

## Date: 4th October 2024

### Summary
- I looked into research papers on machine learning algorithms and churn prediction to gain a wider understanding and understand on how to approach my fyp.

- Initial idea i have is to have multiple different ml models to be used to predict churn such as decision tree, Logistic regression , support vector machines. Then to evaluate them empirically and give some findings on each model.

### Next Steps
- Contiune researching and writing up project plan
- Discuss project plan and my churning sup problem with supervisor before project plan deadline.


## Date: 8/10/24

### Summary
- Completed first draft of project plan. Also created a set of question to be asked for superivors meeting 

## Date: 10/10/24

### Summary
- I met with my supervisor, discussed project plan and got somefeedback on my questions .Went onto to finalise project 
plan and sumbit it.

### Summary
- I have selected the telecom dataset for my project and have been researching exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its importance..
- I plan to carry out EDA on the dataset, and in the meantime, I have been learning about the Seaborn library and how it can be utilised effectively for visualising data during EDA.

### Summary
- I have begun conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the telecom dataset.
- I carried out observations on the distribution of missing data using a heatmap. 
- <img src="Documents\Images\Missing_Values_Heatmap.png" alt="Description of image" width="50%" />
- Might run into issues later, since there are a number of rows with missing data.e.g internet usage and device protection. This would mean it would be harder to establish credible relationships between features hindering churn prediction performance potentially

### Summary
Today, I continued Exploration Data analysis on the Telecom dataset. I utilised the Seaborn library to observe the distribution of churn categories visually and made my observations. Similarly, I made similar observations for other continuous variables, plotting histograms to understand the data better.

However, given that the dataset contains quite a lot of missing data values, I'm planning on changing datasets and researching alternative datasets that might offer more complete information. It would mean I would have to redo EDA, but it should be easier now.
