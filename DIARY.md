# Project Diary

## Date: 1th October 2024

### Summary
- Today, I concentrated on determining the specific sub-problem I will focus on for comparing ML algorithms. After some consideration, I decided to pursue **churn prediction**. 
- I also began evaluating wich datasets i would be using in this project. In contention between Telecom's data set and Bank dataset.

### Next Steps
- Contiune researching and start writing up a project plan
- Research some basic machine learning models, such as nearest neighbours, to establish a foundational understanding.
- Continue exploring potential datasets for benchmarking and implementation in the churn prediction model.

## Date: 4th October 2024

### Summary
- I loooked into research papers on machine learning algorithms and churn prediction to gain a wider understanding and understand on how to approach my fyp.

- Initial idea i have is to have multiple different ml models to be used to predict churn such as decision tree, Logistic regression , support vector machines. Then to evaluate them empirically and give some findings on each model.


### Next Steps
- Contiune researching and writing up project plan
- Discuss project plan and my churning sup problem with supervisor before project plan deadline.
